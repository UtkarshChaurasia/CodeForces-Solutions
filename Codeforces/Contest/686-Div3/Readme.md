## Problem A. [QUESTION](https://codeforces.com/contest/1454/problem/A)

- It was a very simple problem. Overthought a bit which costed some time.<br>
Learning: **Don't overthink on problem A**.

## Problem B. [QUESTION](https://codeforces.com/contest/1454/problem/B)

- It was a simple problem of finding minimum number in an array having frequency 1.
- Can be easily implemented using maps or frequency arrays.
- Used frequency array but due to silly mistakes got **3 WAs** costing heavy penalties.
- **Took a lot of pressure of improving ratings.**<br>
Learning: **Avoid silly mistakes and do not take pressure. Keep Calm**

## Problem C. [QUESTION](https://codeforces.com/contest/1454/problem/C)

- Problem based on the concept of frequency array/map. 
- Included greedy approach.
- Got **2 WAs** again due to pressure could not think of a corner case.<br>
Learning: **Learned two new concept**.
1. **unique()** - Used to removes duplicate of the elements occuring consecutively.
              it just returns a pointer pointing to the new end of the container, and 
              based upon that we have to resize the container, or remove the garbage elements.
                      
2. **resize()** - Used to resize the dynamic arrays.

## Problem D. [QUESTION](https://codeforces.com/contest/1454/problem/D)

- Problem was quite good and needed knowledge of number theory and skills to implement the solution.
- Based on a concept of number theory i.e. **Prime Factors**
- Approach was to find the factor having highest power in prime factorisation of N. And reduce power by 1.
- Map can be used to implement the solution but it is not the memory efficient solution. I used variables and made simple comparisons and 
  updation of variables according to those comaprisons.<br>

Learning: **Learned a new way of solving these kind of problems. Implementation was quite challenging-Memory Optimised Approach.**
<br><br>
**TAKE AWAY**: **Don't take pressure. It reduces the ablity to think. A problems have simple logic and implementation.**
