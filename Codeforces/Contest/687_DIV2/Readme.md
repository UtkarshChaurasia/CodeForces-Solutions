## Problem A. [QUESTION](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/A)

- It was a very simple problem. Took some time to visualize and understand the problem.<br>
Learning: **Need to increase typing speed XD**.

## Problem B. [QUESTION](https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/B)

- It was a very very simple problem.
- Can be easily implemented using a set.
- Was **trying to do it in O(N) without looking at constraints but it could have easily been solved using two nested while loops.**<br>
Learning: **Always go through constraints and if not able to come up with optimized solution then go for naive one(May be that might workðŸ˜‰)**
